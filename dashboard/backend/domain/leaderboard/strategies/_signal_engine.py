"""Shared engine for baseline strategies whose signals are computed on daily
closes but must return an hourly equity curve, since ``base.py``'s contract
promises one and the leaderboard/contest engine feeds ``run()`` hourly bars
throughout (see ``baselines.py::fetch_hourly_bars``, ``TimeFrame.Hour``).

Resamples ``bars_by_symbol`` to one daily close per symbol, evaluates a
strategy's own weight function once per trading day using only closes
strictly before that day (no look-ahead), converts the resulting weights to
share counts, and marks equity every hour in between using intraday prices.

Lookback caveat: the leaderboard's contest window is intentionally short
(one month) with a matching one-month reference buffer before it (see
``leaderboard.json``'s top-level ``reference_start_date``) -- nowhere near
the full year these strategies were originally validated against in the
"Strategy Lab" backtest report. Every ``weight_fn`` here is expected to cap
its own lookback at whatever history is actually available (see
``available_window`` below) rather than require a fixed number of days and
silently produce ``NaN``/empty weights when the contest window is shorter
than that. On the real 1-month contest this means a strategy nominally
described as "252-day momentum" effectively becomes a much shorter-window
version of itself -- an honest consequence of the contest's short window,
not a bug, and documented per-strategy.
