"""Guards for the My Agents shelf sections (2026-08-05).

My Agents used to split agents into two buckets: "Foundation Agents" (whose
subtitle called the product "A prompting game", the #1 trust-killer in every
persona walkthrough) and "External Agents". This task replaces both with four
static shelf sections keyed to the backend category taxonomy
(`dashboard.backend.domain.agents.taxonomy.AGENT_CATEGORIES`), plus the
unchanged external bucket, and adds the canonical no-real-money sentence next
to the capital controls. None of this is enforceable at runtime -- app.html
has no JS test harness -- so, per this suite's frontend convention
(`_frontend_source`), these are asserted against the shipped source directly.

Follow-up (2026-08-23): Crypto and Futures were locked/inert at the time the
guards above were written because no engine supported them. Both now do
(domain/<asset>/backtester.py's run_llm_agent_backtest, an LLM-driven agent
decision loop reusing each asset class's existing day-by-day backtest
machinery), and Options/Forex/Prediction shipped alongside them as three
more live shelves -- so every guard below that specifically pinned "Crypto
and Futures are locked" now asserts the opposite.
